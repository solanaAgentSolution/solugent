## Advanced Setup

If you need to customize the configuration, please refer to the comments in our [.env.example](docker/.env.example) file and update the corresponding values in your `.env` file. Additionally, you might need to make adjustments to the `docker-compose.yaml` file itself, such as changing image versions, port mappings, or volume mounts, based on your specific deployment environment and requirements. After making any changes, please re-run `docker-compose up -d`.
