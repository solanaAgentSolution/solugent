However, from an outsider''s perspective, there seems\n    to be a logical issue with this claim. Coffee is essentially a processed roasted\n    product; however, people naturally associate \"freshness\" with being natural, unprocessed,\n    and minimally processed. If you sell live fish, customers will understand when\n    you say your fish is fresh; however if you sell dried fish and claim it''s fresh\n    too - customers might find it confusing. They may wonder how coffee could be fresh\n    - does Sumida River sell freshly picked coffee beans? So, we worked with Sumida\n    River to reposition their brand, changing \"fresh coffee\" to \"lock-fresh coffee.\"\n    This way, consumers can understand that this company has excellent lock-fresh\n    technology. However, it''s important to note that their lock-fresh technology\n    is genuinely outstanding before we can emphasize this point.'\n  prompt_type: simple\n  retriever_resource:\n    enabled: false\n  sensitive_word_avoidance:\n    configs: []\n    enabled: false\n    type: ''\n  speech_to_text:\n    enabled: false\n  suggested_questions: []\n  suggested_questions_after_answer:\n    enabled: false\n  text_to_speech:\n    enabled: false\n  user_input_form: []\n",
